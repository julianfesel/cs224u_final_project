Identify all entities mentioned in the sentence. Assign a unique identifier to each, starting with 1. Mark entities with asterisks if they are introduced by \\\"The\\\" without specific names.\\n2. Locate the main verb or verbs that describe actions, states, or occurrences. Assign identifiers continuing from the last entity. \\n3. Use syntax to create relations:\\n   - `agent(verb_id, entity_id)` indicates the doer of the action.\\n   - `theme(verb_id, entity_id)` indicates what or whom the action is directed towards.\\n   - `recipient(verb_id, entity_id)` for indirect objects receiving the direct object.\\n   - `nmod.prep(related_entity_id, entity_id)` for prepositional phrases, where `prep` is the preposition.\\n   - `ccomp(verb_id, secondary_action_id)` for clauses that the verb comprehends.\\n   - `xcomp(verb_id, secondary_action_id)` for clauses that are an extension of the action.\\n4. Combine relations using `AND` to form the complete logical form.\\n5. Symbols and syntax rules:\\n   - Entities and actions are separated by semicolons (`;`).\\n   - Relations are listed after actions, separated by `AND`.\\n   - Parentheses group the verb or modifier with the involved entities (`relation(id, id)`).\\n   - Asterisks (`*`) mark definite entities without specific identification.\\n6. Return the logical form\\n\\n---\\nDemonstration with example:\\n\\nSentence: The boy returned the girl the raisin in the house.\\n\\n1. Identify entities: * boy ( 1 ) ; * girl ( 2 ) ; * raisin ( 3 ) ; * house ( 4 )\\n2. Locate main verb/action: returned ( 5 )\\n3. Create relations:\\n   - `agent ( 5 , 1 )` for \\\"The boy\\\" who does the returning.\\n   - `recipient ( 5 , 2 )` for \\\"the girl\\\" who receives.\\n   - `theme ( 5 , 3 )` for \\\"the raisin\\\" being returned.\\n   - `nmod.in ( 3 , 4 )` for \\\"in the house\\\" modifying where \\\"the raisin\\\" is.\\n4. Combine relations: `* boy ( 1 ) ; * girl ( 2 ) ; * raisin ( 3 ) ; * house ( 4 ) ; nmod.in ( 3 , 4 ) AND return ( 5 ) AND agent ( 5 , 1 ) AND recipient ( 5 , 2 ) AND theme ( 5 , 3 )`\\n5. Symbols and syntax applied as described, the full correct logical form for \\\"The boy returned the girl the raisin in the house.\\\" is: \\n6. Return the logical form: \\n* boy ( 1 ) ; * girl ( 2 ) ; * raisin ( 3 ) ; * house ( 4 ) ; nmod . in ( 3 , 4 ) AND return ( 5 ) AND agent ( 5 , 1 ) AND recipient ( 5 , 2 ) AND theme ( 5 , 3 )\\n\\n\\n---\\nSentence to convert:\\nNoah painted a box on the stage . [/INST] 1. Identify entities: Noah (1); box (2); * stage (3)\\n2. Locate main verb/action: painted (4)\\n3. Create relations:\\n   - `agent (4, 1)` for \\\"Noah\\\" who does the painting.\\n   - `theme (4, 2)` for \\\"a box\\\" being painted.\\n   - `nmod.on (2, 3)` for \\\"on the stage\\\" specifying the location.\\n4. Combine relations: Noah (1) ; box (2) ; * stage (3) ; nmod.on (2, 3) AND paint (4) AND agent (4, 1) AND theme (4, 2)</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
